   About my project
   1. This project is based on Star wars where we are fetching data from https://swapi.dev/api/planets/?format=json.
   2. This will give me data with JSON format which contains data such as climate, residents, population etc.
   3. In residents we have an array of api which will give data for table which contains name, mass, gender, height.
   4. Based on the above data we have displayed a single page web application which contains pagination as well.
   5. But as now we have displayed same data across all paginations.
   6. Attached the deploymjment link for reference - https://star-wars-wheat.vercel.app/
